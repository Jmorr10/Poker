# Description:
Each component of this program serves a different purpose, FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON USE OF EACH SEE LIST BELOW:

* Problem #1 - The object of this problem was to generate an ArrayList or an array that represents a standard deck 52 playing cards. Once the deck is created, it is to be printed out in order, shuffled, and then printed out again. To test this, one must include either “t1” or “test1” in the command line arguments. For this problem, a subclass Card was used. This problem was solved by using an ArrayList to hold the Card objects. To generate the deck, a “for” loop was used to cycle through the suits and values to create Card objects which are then stored in the ArrayList. The showDeck method simply cycles through the ArrayList and prints the toString value of each Card object. The shuffleDeck method uses Collections.shuffle() to randomize the order of the Card objects.

* Problem #2 - The object of this problem was to deal two 5-card hands by drawing from the deck, display the hands, and then show the remaining cards in the deck. To test this, one must include either “t2” or “test2” in the command line arguments. An if-statement using a modulus operator was used to simulate the alternating addition of cards to the hand (i.e. the player first, then the deal, then the player, etc.) The card to be added to a hand was always taken from the top of the deck to simulate real life conditions. Since the deck is an ArrayList, Card objects could be easily removed from the deck and added to the user and dealer hands (both of which are also ArrayLists).

* Problem #3 – The object of this problem was to enable the program to classify the various possible hands in the game of poker when presented with a hand to evaluate. To do this, an enumeration was used to rank the hand types. Starting with the lowest rank, “High Card”, and moving to the highest rank “Royal Flush”. The program first counts the number of each suit in the hand to be evaluated. It then checks for a Royal Flush, followed by a Straight Flush, Straight, Four of a Kind, Full House, and finally a Flush. If none of these are found the determineHandMatches method is called to check for pairs and Three of a Kind. To test this, one must include either “t3” or “test3” in the command line arguments. The following notation is used for inputting a command line string-based hand in the form of: VXVXVXVXVX, where V is the value of the card {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,t,J,j,Q,q,K,k,A,a} and X is the suit of the card {C,c,H,h,S,s,D,d}.

* Problem #4 – The object of this problem was to enable the program to compare two hands and determine which hand “wins”.  This is done in the compareHands method where the hands are first evaluated for the hand_type enumeration. If both are ONE_PAIR, the program then compares the rank of the pairs to determine which hand has the higher ranking pair. If the user and dealer have the same hand_type then the program determines the high card to determine the winner. If the initial high cards are equal, the program loops to find the next high card until a winner is determined. Otherwise, if the user and dealer have different hand_type, the ordinal properties of the two hand_type are compared. The winner is determined by who has the highest hand_type ordinal. To test this, one must include either “t4” or “test4” in the command line arguments. The following notation is used for inputting two command line string-based hands (separated by a space in the command line argument list) in the form of: VXVXVXVXVX, where V is the value of the card {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,t,J,j,Q,q,K,k,A,a} and X is the suit of the card {C,c,H,h,S,s,D,d}.

* Problem #5 – The object of this program was to create the actual playing procedure for the poker game. The command line arguments “o” and “open” can be user to allow the player to see the dealer’s cards. The following requirements for the procedure were specified: user starts will $100 credit, asks if the user wants to play another hand, if the user does not want to it prints the user’s credit, if the user does play it takes a $5 buy in (deviated from the $1 buy-in for aesthetic reasons), the amount of the pot is displayed. The program first generates a deck, shuffles the deck, and then deals two hands.  The user then has the opportunity to raise or fold. After which, the user has the chance to exchange 3 to 4 cards (4 only if the user has an Ace). The user can then fold, raise, or check. The showdown then occurs where the winner is determined.

NOTES ON GRAPHICS:  For the sake of higher learning and practice in Java programming, I decided to make this a graphics-based game. The “cards” are JLabels that have been assigned an image. The images for the cards are open source and therefore can be used freely in the program. Multiple JPanels are used and positioned on the JFrame. Various layouts (especially GridBagLayout) are used to positions the elements on the content pane. An activity log is displayed to keep the user informed of the activity of the program. In addition, when the user goes to exchange cards, a mouseListener is added to the JLabels to enable the user to click on the cards that they want to exchange.

Poker.java:
This class contains the methods and subclasses needed for the poker game to function.

# Parts Implemented:
All but that which is included in Parts Not Implemented.

# Parts Not Implemented:
During an open game, the user cannot see the remaining cards of the deck. This was NOT intentionally left out. I accidentally forgot to add this feature.

# Notes:
In addition to the graphical interface, the dealer has been programmed with a basic artificial intelligence concerning betting, folding, checking, and exchanging cards.

# Known Bugs:
There are no known bugs so long as the user enters the correct form and content for command line arguments during test cases 3 and 4.

# Extra Credit:
See Notes.
